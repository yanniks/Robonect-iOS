# Robonect iOS App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yanniks/Robonect-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yanniks/Robonect-iOS)

This app is developed to easily control a [Robonect](http://www.robonect.de/) equipped lawn mower. Since this is still a WIP, don't expect too much. See the [Fastlane README](fastlane/README.md) on ideas how to start.
